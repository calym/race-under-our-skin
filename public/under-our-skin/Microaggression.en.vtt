00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.558
Microaggression

00:00:01.558 --> 00:00:02.955
[Keli Carender] It just seems like

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:04.999
something The Onion came up with.

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.920
Just putting the word “micro”

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.643
in front of “aggression”—

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:09.890
because it’s not a big aggression,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.806
it’s just a micro one.

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.111
[Louis Chude-Sokei] A microaggression is

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.853
supposed to be small, seemingly innocent,

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.564
sometimes unintentional, naïve or

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:26.693
ignorant interactions.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.552
[Mark Olsen] The things that are done

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:34.861
unintentionally that are...that can

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:37.499
be viewed as derogatory, pejorative.

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.655
[Tariqa Waters] I think microaggressions

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:41.772
are bullsh...I’m sorry. I’m trying not

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:43.427
to curse. But that is just...

00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:45.612
it’s just too much of, you know,

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:50.014
just over-explaining your ignorance.

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:51.847
Microaggressions. I don’t think that...

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:54.260
When you’re receiving it, they’re not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.988
“micro.” I think it’s easier for the

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.884
person who’s doing it to use that term.

00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:00.037
[Rachael DeCruz] Microaggressions, to me,

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:02.705
are sort of like those small little actions

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.269
or comments that communicate to people that

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.195
they’re less than or aren’t worthy.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.287
[Cynthia Tee] One of my black students...

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:11.212
She often gets approached and told

00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:13.688
that she’s very articulate.

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:15.463
And so there’s a microaggression there,

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:19.386
because it comes from people who just,

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:22.209
unknown to them, automatically assume

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.317
that a lot of black people

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:24.621
are not very articulate.

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:25.500
[Rachael DeCruz] “You’re so smart!”

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.148
“You’re so elequent!” And I feel like

00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:29.121
the piece that they’re leaving off is, like,

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.532
“...despite that you’re a woman of color.”

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:32.855
“Oh, you’re standing out from this

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:34.854
group of people that I had previously

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:35.893
thought something else of.”

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:37.388
[Marcelas Owens] It’s like when people

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:38.497
tell me that I don’t act

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.866
like a regular black person.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.901
[Tariqa Waters] “Oh, you look like

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.890
you came out of the African gallery.”

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.359
As beautiful as, you know, my ancestry

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.759
and my culture is? And “Good for you

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.842
working here. Good for you.” A lot of that.

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:53.970
[Sean Riley] They may not feel like much

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.804
individually, but they add up.

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:59.583
And, to me, they are little fractures

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:03.317
that spotlight racism. We see that

00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:05.468
you do think another is inferior

00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:07.233
or that you are superior.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:08.987
[Rachael DeCruz] It’s traumatizing.

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:10.717
And it’s also just kind of a constant

00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:13.334
reminder that the world you walk in

00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:16.074
and you live in wasn’t made for you,

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:17.512
and isn’t always safe for you.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:18.383
[Varisha Khan] It makes me feel

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:19.909
like I don’t belong in the country

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.312
that I was born in. Microaggressions,

00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:25.645
to me, are asking, “Wouldn’t I like to

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.345
let my hair down, just once?” or

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:29.208
“Wouldn’t I like to wear a swimsuit

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.538
on a beach just once?” I’m suddenly

00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:34.456
reminded that I’m not seen for my character,

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.376
or for my actions, or for how good

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.271
I am as a person. Rather, I’m just seen

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.765
for the headscarf that’s on my head.

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:40.606
[Autumn Bennett] If I say, “Oh, like,

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:41.732
I can definitely see that you may

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:42.956
be Asian, because I can tell, like,

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:46.499
by your eyes,” is that a microaggression?

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.906
[M. Lorena González] You think you’re

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:49.830
giving a compliment, but you’re really not.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.755
[Rachael DeCruz] It’s like,

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:52.527
“Oh, you’re so exotic looking.”

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:54.280
[Leija Farr] Like, when a guy will tell me

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.351
that I’m pretty. And then he’ll say, like,

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.237
“Oh, so what are you mixed with?”

00:02:59.237 --> 00:03:01.218
And I’m like, “Um, I’m black.”

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:02.494
That’s a microaggression.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:03.577
Like they’re basically trying to tell you

00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:05.573
that just being pure black,

00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:06.851
you can’t be beautiful.

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.179
You have to be mixed with something.

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.049
[Autumn Bennett] People ask me all the time,

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.859
like, “What nationality are you?”

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.378
And I’m like, “Well, you know, my mom

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:13.619
is Syrian and Czechoslovakian

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:14.348
and my dad was Haitian,”

00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:15.631
and I think that’s friggin’ cool.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.467
What if people are just, like,

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:18.596
being curious?

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:19.668
[Varisha Khan] People ask us if,

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.157
you know...We do speak English.

00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:22.826
But they’ll kind of talk slowly

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.745
and try to make sense of the words

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:25.931
we’re saying, or it’s as if they’re

00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.868
trying to process the fact that

00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:28.945
we actually are speaking fluent English.

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:30.292
This is my first language.

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:31.099
[Keli Carender] When we think of the word

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.057
“aggressive,” I think that is, you know,

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:37.059
deliberate. To make it seem like it’s a

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.346
little bit more than offensive. Like,

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:40.549
it’s almost a physical attack, you know.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.623
Almost like they’re touching you.

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:43.283
[Jerrell Davis] When I was at SPU,

00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:46.339
I used to have an afro. Kids would come up

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.922
behind me and touch my hair.

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:51.690
Like, no permission. I don’t know them.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.309
Come up behind me, and touch my hair.

00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.617
And I turn around and slap their hand away.

00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:58.127
I’m like, “What are you doing?”

00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:01.276
They’re like, “It’s just so soft.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:02.702
It just looks so soft. I just wanted

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:05.617
to touch it.” Look, let me come up behind

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:08.745
a white girl and start touching her hair.

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:10.517
I’m locked up with the quickness.

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:11.741
[Leija Farr] Some people might see that

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.095
as, like, nice, but I really don’t.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:16.738
I feel like that’s kind of offensive to,

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.149
like, ask somebody can you touch their hair.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.665
Like, if their hair is in a style

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.829
that you’re not used to.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.068
[Tariqa Waters] It’s this weird, you know,

00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:27.830
like, fetish, weird thing that white people

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.979
have with our hair that’s absolutely...

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.054
I don’t know what it is.

00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:34.306
[M. Lorena González] A couple years ago,

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:38.380
during Halloween, I was parking my car

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.120
in a garage in downtown. And this older white

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.270
gentleman saw me get out of my car,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.246
and he’s very, very social.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.664
And he asked me what they call Halloween

00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:55.849
in my country. And I told him,

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.963
“Well, they call it Halloween,

00:04:58.963 --> 00:05:01.389
because this is my country.”

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.814
To be honest, I cared less about

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:10.443
how he felt about being the microaggressor

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.478
and more about how it made me feel.

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:15.902
It’s about the impact and not

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.142
about the intent of the person

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:21.985
who engaged in that behavior.

00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:23.934
[Keli Carender] We’ve gone really far in

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:27.170
saying it’s all about what the person

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.889
receiving it thinks that it means.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.026
[Autumn Bennett] I also think it has to do

00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:34.502
with people just not really having,

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:37.533
like, a backbone. And I think we’ve become

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.139
this society where these, like,

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.012
kids are these, like, delicate orchids

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:43.942
that just wilt once they leave the greenhouse.

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:44.605
They just die.

00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:46.414
[Tariqa Waters] I’d rather for them to just

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:48.247
call me a nigger because it would have been

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.644
easier to take. It’s easier to take just,

00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:52.418
you know, just overt, you know,

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.878
just racial slurs than the way people

00:05:54.878 --> 00:05:57.318
try to dress it up as not being a

00:05:57.318 --> 00:06:01.243
racial exchange at all.

00:06:01.243 --> 00:06:01.916
[Keli Carender] I don’t know.

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:03.846
It just seems...it just seems ridiculous,

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:05.677
and there’s just, like, so many things

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:06.660
to remember now that you’re not supposed

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.619
to say, you can’t do, you can’t think it...

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:09.644
[Cynthia Tee] The people who commit

00:06:09.644 --> 00:06:12.019
the microaggression are like,

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.150
“Do you mean I have to think about

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.926
every little thing I say and do?

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.919
It feels very painful.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.295
It feels very tedious to do that.”

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.074
And my response to that is,

00:06:23.074 --> 00:06:25.296
“Yes. For you now, finally, in your

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:29.556
adult life to experience this effort?

00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:33.268
It’s about time. Because the people

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.146
that you have done this microaggression to

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.966
have experienced it all their lives.”

00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:39.165
[Louis Chude-Sokei] People who are hostile

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.806
to the notion of microaggressions

00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:45.171
assume that games are being played.

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.841
Assume that this is actually driven

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:48.755
by specific political agendas.

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:50.695
It’s the “victim card.” I think

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:53.361
people don’t understand that there’s

00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:56.361
actually pain there. I’m really split

00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.379
on the issue of microaggressions, you know,

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:01.343
because I don’t want to deny anyone’s pain,

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:06.251
but I also can’t imagine a world

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:09.078
where interacting with difference

00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:11.212
is done without pain.
