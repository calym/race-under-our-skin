00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.345

Color blindness

00:00:01.345 --> 00:00:02.926
[Leija Farr] I think it’s funny when people

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:04.464
say that. Like, “I’m color blind. I don’t

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:06.229
see color.” Like, of course you see color.

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:07.743
[Rachael DeCruz] Color blindness, to me,

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.736
means denying the fact that racism exists

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:12.281
and racism still impacts us.

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.566
[Mark Olsen] I believe that all people

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.835
are wonderfully and fearfully made,

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:21.839
and diversity is a part of God’s creation.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.338
If it’s kind of, “Well, we need to stop,

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:27.801
you know, stereotyping based on different

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.763
colors.” If that’s color blindness, okay,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.176
I can see what they’re saying there.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.676
But I think if we’re going to talk

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:33.949
about true color blindness, I don’t...

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.511
I think that does a disservice.

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.626
Because we’re ignoring

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:40.076
major parts of people’s lives.

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.575
[Greg Rickel] I think there’s a richness

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.973
in our diversity. And I think color blindness

00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:47.095
kind of tries to erase that. And it’s also

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:50.240
a jump to denial. It’s a way to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.037
put the conversation at rest.

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:55.051
[Louis Chude-Sokei] It’s become a bad word.

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.653
There was a time when it was the goal.

00:00:56.653 --> 00:00:57.205
[Darrell Hillaire] I think that’s a

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:58.923
good word, you know? I think that’s a

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:00.996
good word when we reach that point of

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:04.812
color blindness, and you don’t see race—

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.668
you see a person.

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:08.872
[Varisha Khan] Yes, it’s a great idea.

00:01:08.872 --> 00:01:10.095
Like, it’s a great goal.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.287
It’s a great vision to have.

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:12.747
Let’s be in a world where we don’t

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:14.232
have to worry about differences.

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:16.032
And to truly value each other—

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:17.447
for just our character,

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:18.885
for just our personality,

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.019
for just our experiences—

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:21.624
would be a great thing.

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:23.362
I’d love to see that one day.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:26.128
But the reality is, we’re, you know,

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.296
in a world that does see difference.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.346
[Keli Carender] I think a lot of people

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:34.049
were raised to not...to not take color

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:38.160
as the main thing about a person.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.247
It’s really jarring, I think,

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:42.672
and very hard to understand

00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:45.289
why somebody would want to have everyone

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.750
pay attention to what color they are,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.192
when you’ve worked your whole life

00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:52.732
to try to make sure that people are

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:54.962
treated equally regardless of color.

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:55.576
[Louis Chude-Sokei] There are a lot of white

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:57.620
people who are indeed "colorblind" because

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.704
they were taught by black people to be.

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:03.039
This is a good thing.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.226
And so they don’t realize that, well, no,

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:07.554
you were taught by one segment of the

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:09.723
black political world to be.

00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:11.865
There are other segments that

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.518
believe quite different things.

00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:16.790
It’s an older solution, right?

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.924
It’s an older solution

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:19.102
that has become a problem.

00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:21.719
[Duck Bae] Being colorblind essentially

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.429
means that we’re trying to homogenize

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.097
everyone that we see. So it might be

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.417
a noble effort, in some cases,

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:32.985
but homogenization of any culture inevitably

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.860
has us slowly drifting towards

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.582
being the white ideal.

00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:39.509
[Jerrell Davis] Like, if you’re saying,

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.764
“Oh, I don’t see you as black.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:43.326
I just see you as Jerrell.” Like, no, bro.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.908
I want you to see me as black.

00:02:44.908 --> 00:02:46.370
Like, that’s why I got dreadlocks.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.531
That’s why, you know, I’m saying, like...

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:49.497
That’s why I talk like this.

00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:52.775
That’s why I wear my Africa gear. You know?

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:55.902
Like, I’m proud to be what I am.

00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:59.621
And people that say they’re colorblind

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.475
or say that they don’t see that?

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.037
I think that speaks more to their internal

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:07.881
struggle than it does to the external.

00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:08.791
[Varisha Khan] It’s almost as if it comes

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:11.899
from a place of discomfort. And, you know,

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.879
as if I don’t want to hear about race.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.731
And as if it’s a problem

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.797
that we have different races.

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.494
And that we have different backgrounds.

00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:22.454
[Lucas Nydam] Even if, for some reason,

00:03:22.454 --> 00:03:24.087
you were completely colorblind,

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:26.531
it wouldn’t matter. Because the schools

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.077
see color. The jails see color. Like,

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:30.707
with systemic racism you don’t even

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:32.887
have to see color because the systems

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:34.498
we’ve made will see color for you.

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:36.234
[Cynthia Tee] I don’t think anybody

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:38.678
can truly be colorblind. I don’t think

00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:41.241
being colorblind as a person actually exists.

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.558
[Tariqa Waters] If you just meet me, I think

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:45.223
you know you better not come out your mouth

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:47.239
and say, “I don’t see color.”

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.700
And unless you’re in this just utopia of

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.784
“race doesn’t exist anymore and

00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:55.922
we’re just all one”...I always like to refer

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.843
to it as like the movie Avatar.

00:03:58.843 --> 00:03:59.883
We’re just gonna be blue.

00:03:59.883 --> 00:04:01.296
[Jerrell Davis] It’s self-defeating. Like,

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:02.569
“I’m colorblind. I don’t see the fact

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.608
that we’re all different.”

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.540
You just said that we’re all different!

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.382
[Autumn Bennett] Kids see different colors

00:04:07.382 --> 00:04:09.667
of skin. Babies see it. I can tell when

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.876
I meet a baby that has not seen a black person

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.085
before because they’re like, “Oh!”

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:15.678
It’s just this reaction, and it’s super weird.

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.296
Overall, sure: it doesn’t matter

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.766
what race someone is. But do we see it?

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.512
Absolutely. And it’s beautiful.

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:21.416
It’s really cool.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:24.125
[Duck Bae] I have no idea what I’d rather

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.397
have the term be rather than “colorblind.”

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:29.757
Color-thoughtful? Color-minded?

00:04:29.757 --> 00:04:31.847
I have no idea. Colorblindness doesn’t stop

00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:33.300
to think about accommodations that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.796
might need to be made for races.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:36.014
[Cynthia Tee] I used to struggle a lot

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:38.087
with this notion of why you need

00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:40.012
to treat people differently. Like, why?

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.332
If we’re all equal, you shouldn’t have to

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:43.793
treat anybody differently. But now I’ve

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:47.295
come around to the other side, realizing that

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:49.104
if the environment you’re in

00:04:49.104 --> 00:04:52.504
is fundamentally biased, you do need to treat

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:54.371
people differently. Like, you just do.

00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.074
[Keli Carender] I think you can be

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:57.050
a person that says “I’m colorblind,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.395
because I treat everyone equally

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.382
regardless of their skin color,”

00:05:00.382 --> 00:05:03.030
and still be completely, you know...

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.224
And still understand that people have

00:05:04.224 --> 00:05:07.724
different experiences or cultures or whatever.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.474
[Michael Dixon] It’s a false premise.

00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:12.940
Everybody’s conscious of color.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.916
They just don’t understand it.
