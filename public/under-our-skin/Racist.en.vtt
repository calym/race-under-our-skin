WEBVTT

00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.480
Racist

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.746
What does “racist” mean to you?

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:04.268
[Keli Carender] People today...

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:05.372
the worst thing you can possibly

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.107
call a person is a racist.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.544
[Greg Rickel] When you hear the word “racist,”

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:10.659
what do you envision in your mind?

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.169
Because I think a lot of it is, you know,

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.942
a very extreme version of what that is,

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:18.757
instead of the very subtle ways that

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.898
we all do it. All participate in it.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.347
All cause it to be real.

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:25.386
[Cynthia Tee] I think the word “racist”

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:27.666
just gets thrown around a lot among all

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.500
the kids, you know. Whether they actually

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.876
understand what it means is an entirely

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:32.520
different story.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.669
[Louis Chude-Sokei] I guess the classical

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:36.613
definition of a racist is someone

00:00:36.613 --> 00:00:41.499
who believes that who you are,

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.916
what you are capable of, everything

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:46.155
about you—intellectually, spiritually,

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:49.467
culturally, historically—is due to your race.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.809
[Michael Dixon] What makes people racist

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.099
is when they attach themselves to an

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:59.066
ideological movement: us against them.

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.691
[Keli Carender] Calling somebody a racist

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:05.337
is saying that, I mean, that their heart

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:06.945
is just filled with hate.

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.640
That they literally hate somebody

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.965
because of the way they look,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:11.925
because of their skin color.

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:13.701
That they want to discriminate against them.

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:16.441
A true racist is a very bad person.

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.160
[Duck Bae] Racism [is] associated with

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.545
being, like, bad and evil, and so

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:21.913
you’re never going to admit to yourself

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:22.727
that you’re racist.

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:25.762
[Greg Rickel] Well, I am a racist.

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.525
I say I am a recovering one.

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:31.578
Being a white male from the South,

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:34.751
you know, I think I’m probably in the

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.824
category that’s the ultimate racist.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:40.720
And being marinated in that all your life,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.967
you can’t help but carry that with you.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.881
And what I see a lot of white people do

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.894
is decide they’re not a racist.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:49.469
“They’re not talking to me or about me.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.375
We sure do need to do something about it.

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:55.996
But it doesn’t include me, because what

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.050
they’re talking about is something else.”

00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:00.826
And I think that’s the biggest, I would

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.909
call it, sin. I didn’t really get to a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.803
place of dealing with this until I was

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:07.661
able to say “I’m a racist.”

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.014
[Keli Carender] If you go out of your way

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:12.072
to accuse somebody of something that

00:02:12.072 --> 00:02:13.855
now has been defined as a very dirty,

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.069
horrible thing, they’re going to be

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.451
very much less likely to come

00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:19.359
to the table and talk to you about things.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.212
Most of the people in our country are

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:23.280
good people. Right? Most people have good

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.868
intentions. Most people are trying.

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:26.919
[Duck Bae] Even if you associate racism

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.457
with being bad, and you yourself don’t

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:30.160
think you’re a bad person, you might

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.497
still be part of the problem.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:32.400
[Autumn Bennett] If you’re walking past

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.935
a certain part of town, like, you feel

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.170
a little more conscious of your purse.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.829
You may lock your doors. That’s, like,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.704
this natural instinct that we have to

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:39.474
protect ourselves.

00:02:39.474 --> 00:02:42.391
[Michael Dixon] Like, I am a little

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:47.992
intimidated to be by myself, walking down

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:50.121
the street, and . . . say there’s a

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.864
white woman coming this way. If I’m on

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:54.987
the same sidewalk, I get as far over

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:59.376
as I can. Because I know. And because

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:03.862
those are some of the fears that people have.

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:05.433
[Jerrell Davis] Everybody on Earth

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.846
has prejudice. It’s a survival tactic

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:09.175
of human beings.

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:10.504
[Greg Rickel] You know, when you’re living

00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:12.505
in denial that you’re not a racist, then

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:15.305
none of that stuff is racism.

00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:17.502
“Oh, I just made a mistake.” You know?

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:18.914
“I just made a mistake.”

00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:20.007
[Mark Olsen] I think you can say something

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:21.632
that is racist and it doesn’t necessarily

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:24.629
mean that you are racist. And if I say

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.071
something that is racist and I don’t mean

00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.832
to say it, though, but somebody perceives

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:33.225
it as racist, that doesn’t make me then

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:36.014
this big, white, racist person.

00:03:36.014 --> 00:03:38.876
That makes me ignorant. And maybe even stupid.

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:40.071
[Tariqa Waters] I’m not going to bite

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:41.482
my tongue anymore. I’m not going to just

00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:43.419
take it. I will call you out and say,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.620
you know, “What you’re doing—you know,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.928
how you’re addressing me—is racist.”

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.868
And that gets scary in and of itself

00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:52.150
because nobody wants to be called a racist.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.140
And I understand that. But don’t say

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.764
racist things, then. It’s 2016.

00:03:56.764 --> 00:03:58.148
You know when you’re being racist.

00:03:58.148 --> 00:03:59.515
You know when you’re being ignorant.

00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:00.996
[Mark Olsen] We tend to value perception

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:08.076
and emotion maybe over, kind of, facts.

00:04:08.076 --> 00:04:09.605
If we feel like it’s racist, then it

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:10.763
must be, when I don’t know that

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:11.517
that’s always the case.

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:12.386
[Keli Carender] I think intent plays

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:16.209
a lot into it. I think about, like,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.091
murder charges. There’s manslaughter,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.512
right, versus murder.

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:20.620
[Rachael DeCruz] Regardless of whatever

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.852
someone’s intent was, like, the outcome

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.747
and how you feel is what matters.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:27.517
And if, you know, if you feel you’re

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.698
being discriminated against

00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:30.039
because of your race, that’s real.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.489
[M. Lorena González] It could be

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:32.982
that one time when I went to go

00:04:32.982 --> 00:04:35.282
put in gas in a small eastern

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:37.578
Washington town, and the clerk refused

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:40.130
to touch my hand when I gave her money.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.599
[Tariqa Waters] You know, “How did you

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.850
get this place?” You know, “Oh my God,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.483
how do you afford to live here?”

00:04:45.483 --> 00:04:48.825
And thinking I sell weed.

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:53.235
Blatantly, overt racist remarks.

00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:56.545
I’ve not had it ever anywhere else

00:04:56.545 --> 00:04:57.603
but Seattle.

00:04:57.603 --> 00:04:59.475
[Darrell Hillaire] Our kids at the Academy

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:02.830
being called niggers. To their face.

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:05.515
In school. By white kids.

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:07.033
[Varisha Khan] People are leaving things

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:08.390
at our mosques. They’re leaving, like,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.705
pigs’ heads and, you know, just people

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:14.824
graffiti-ing, tagging our schools—

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:16.190
our, you know, Islamic schools.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.020
I don’t know if I’m going to be inside

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.918
a mosque when it’s going to be

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.151
firebombed at any point.

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.634
And people have been killed.

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:21.570
[Keli Carender] I believe in freedom

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.629
and I think people have the freedom

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.136
to be prejudiced people. It doesn’t mean

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:25.885
they’re maybe going to have very many friends,

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:27.400
or that they’re going to be very popular,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.500
or they’re going to get elected to office.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.682
[Autumn Bennett] I believe, yes, there is

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:32.280
individuals who will always be racist.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.406
There’s always assholes in every category.

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:35.905
There’s no way you can eliminate that

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.360
because that is eliminating opinion

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.847
and mindset and how people have grown up.

00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:41.108
[Mark Olsen] What’s funny is we tend to...

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:43.528
We tend, when we think of people being racist,

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:46.200
we think of it as white people against

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.854
non-white people, or non-white people against

00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:50.829
white people. We don’t, we don’t often think

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.229
of the different minorities being

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.506
racist against each other.

00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:55.490
[Darrell Hillaire] There’s no such thing

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.605
as, like, reverse racism or, you know,

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:01.587
white racism. Racism is racism.

00:06:01.587 --> 00:06:02.879
[Greg Rickel] I don’t agree with people

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.102
that say that everybody can be racist.

00:06:05.102 --> 00:06:07.697
I don’t really buy it because, to me,

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:10.230
race is really attached to power and privilege.

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:13.511
So in different societies it may be different,

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:17.597
but I think in our society, white people

00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:20.636
have to own this more.

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:22.043
[Jerrell Davis] I mean, that’s true.

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:23.475
Yes, I think it’s true that black people

00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:27.359
can’t be racist. We can be hella discriminatory.

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:30.344
We can be hella prejudiced. Yeah, but they

00:06:30.344 --> 00:06:31.864
can’t be racist because they don’t have

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:34.514
a system and a structure and an institution

00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:37.693
that’s attached to those beliefs that give

00:06:37.693 --> 00:06:40.659
them a leg up in all situations.

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:42.445
[Darrell Hillaire] Racism is a result of

00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:45.866
ignorance. When you think about ignorance,

00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:48.735
what’s missing from ignorance is empathy.
