00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:01.896
All Lives Matter

00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:03.005
[Leija Farr] “Black Lives Matter?

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.427
What about all lives? All lives matter.”

00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:06.736
That’s what people always say.

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:08.609
Your cries for help don’t matter, basically.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:09.542
That’s what I hear.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.915
[Marci Owens] When you say “all lives matter,”

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:13.377
you’re kind of trying to avoid the problem

00:00:13.377 --> 00:00:14.738
of race and you kind of don’t want to talk

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:15.803
about race, so you’re trying to say

00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:16.606
“all lives matter.”

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.980
[Jerrell Davis] If you’re offended by me

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.127
saying me and people that look like me

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:27.351
matter, why does that offend you?

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.972
Why does that upset you?

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:31.324
[Lucas Nydam] I think it’s just probably

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:33.847
a combination of fragility and not really

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:36.720
understanding systemic racism is why I

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.955
think people respond to that. And it’s like,

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.503
I mean, no one, no one, like, no one’s

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:43.895
going to disagree that all lives matter.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.417
[Mark Olsen] By default I think most people say,

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:47.048
“Well, if you’re saying Black Lives Matter,

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:48.357
what about everybody else?”

00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:49.595
Honestly, I’ve yet to hear anybody say

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.584
“white lives matter” as the counter.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.580
It’s “all lives matter,” which is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.228
actually pretty inclusive to

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:55.454
other minorities as well.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.777
[Tariqa Waters] That’s white privilege.

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:58.274
“All lives matter.” Of course all lives matter.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.400
All lives aren’t getting shot up

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.842
in the streets by the police!

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:02.915
[Louis Chude-Sokei] I think that there are

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.823
people who genuinely did not know that

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.649
Black Lives Matter is specifically about

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.998
police violence and criminal incarceration.

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:12.563
Or they just saw the term, then said,

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:13.980
“Oh, you’re privileging black lives

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.432
above others.” Right? And this is a part

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.826
of the larger discourse of racism and

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.150
white privilege, you know. For example,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.761
“Why do you have African-American History Month?

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.330
Well, why don’t we have a white-history month?”

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.254
Clearly there’s a history that they do not

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.661
know or don’t want to know.

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.865
[Jerrell Davis] Like, we have to explain why

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:35.437
it’s wrong that 12-year-olds are

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.580
getting gunned down.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.513
Why do I have to explain that to someone?

00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:41.682
[Mark Olsen] I see both sides of it.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:45.181
I understand the idea that black lives matter.

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.592
I understand. I can’t...

00:01:47.592 --> 00:01:52.674
I can’t relate to that because I’m, I’m not, I’m not black.

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:53.517
[Keli Carender] I think that the

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:56.398
Black Lives Matter movement has some

00:01:56.398 --> 00:01:57.650
legitimate complaints.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.330
Libertarians for decades have been pushing

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.942
criminal justice reform. But, again,

00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:03.625
I think the way that it’s been implemented

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:07.903
has been very anti-speech and anti-thought.

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:08.700
[Mark Olsen] I think some people are

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.020
frustrated at, you know, actually at the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.031
Black Lives Matter movement because

00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:14.740
they don’t . .I think some people perceive

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.262
it as not being helpful. People walking on

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.258
the freeways and, you know,

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.304
smashing things.

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.585
They go, “How is that helpful?

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.968
How is that bringing us together as a community?

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:24.788
That’s only dividing people.”

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:26.726
[Greg Rickel] This is where Black Lives Matter

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:28.179
to me is so important. Because they’re

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:32.004
attempting to speak and to have us listen.

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.456
And instead of us trying to jump to

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.942
“all lives matter,” or you know,

00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:38.641
“Let’s figure out what’s gonna…”

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.968
I think it’s just our place to listen

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:43.410
and to try to follow a little bit, too.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.666
[Cynthia Tee] I remember being really surprised

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.946
when it came up—”all lives matter.”

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:51.014
Because it’s such an obvious thing

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:52.519
that all lives matter.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.541
But that’s just not the point.

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.615
[Rachael DeCruz] The way, like, reframing

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.458
like that has been used is a way to

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:58.869
kind of not have the conversation about race,

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.508
and to not have a conversation about how

00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:03.412
black people in this country are being treated,

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.638
and how we’re...how we allow ourselves

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:07.242
to live with that.

00:03:07.242 --> 00:03:08.608
[Darrell Hillaire] You see their response to it

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:09.803
—it’s, like, viewed as a threat.

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:11.583
Instead of saying, “Yeah, you’re right,

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.638
you know. Those things are wrong and

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:16.286
in this history, there’s a lot of things wrong.”

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:17.017
It’s easier just to say,

00:03:17.017 --> 00:03:18.362
“Well, all lives matter.”

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:20.145
[Michael Dixon] They figure that they need to

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:24.877
add that addendum—not to strengthen the idea,

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:26.273
but to dilute it.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.494
[Jerrell Davis] I can’t believe that

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:31.075
anyone that responds to Black Lives Matter

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:35.574
with “all lives matter” truly believes

00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:38.291
that all lives matter. Because if you did,

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.109
you’d be sitting here.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.272
You’d be protesting with us.

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:44.705
Black Lives Matter does not stand in isolation.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.102
It’s not something that was created

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.839
out of thin air. Black Lives Matter

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.961
comes from the civil rights movement.

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:57.331
It comes from a continued pursuit of

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.185
equitable treatment for people of color

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:01.597
—all people of color.

00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:03.548
[Michael Dixon] When you say “Black Lives Matter,"

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:06.583
you’re saying “all lives matter.”
