00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
Safe Space

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.736
[Cynthia Tee] A safe space is where you

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:08.867
feel like you can do something or say

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:13.353
something and not be harmed as a result.

00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:14.730
[Marci Owens] And when you know that

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.193
you’re not going to be attacked for

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:17.805
thinking a certain way, you’re more

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.614
open to let your ideas out and kind of

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:22.989
tell how you’re really feeling.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.852
We can kind of be real about things.

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:26.584
[Lucas Nydam] The most real

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:30.316
conversations I’ve had about race, or any...

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.579
gender—anything—have happened in safe spaces.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.507
Like, people are like, “Oh, you’re coddling.

00:00:34.507 --> 00:00:36.074
You’re not talking about these things.”

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.142
It’s like, no, safe spaces allow people

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.893
to talk about those things when you set

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:41.628
these ground rules to try to make

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:42.651
people comfortable.

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:43.764
[Rachael DeCruz] And by “comfortable,” I mean

00:00:43.764 --> 00:00:46.397
that I’m not fearing being discriminated

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:49.547
against, harassed, bullied. That I just feel

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:50.938
like I can speak my mind and I’m not

00:00:50.938 --> 00:00:52.521
going to be judged in any way for it.

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.272
[Sean Riley] It isn’t absent of constructive

00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:57.389
tension or conflict.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.924
[Tariqa Waters] That’s the safe space for me,

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:03.895
I think. You know? Just to be able to express

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.747
what it is that I’m saying. And if I stumble,

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:08.616
or if I said something that’s out of turn,

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:10.947
or inappropriate, then you just check me on it.

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.098
[Jerrell Davis] Thinking about safe spaces,

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:17.972
I would define them as places of comfort

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:20.506
where there are like-minded people.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:24.276
[Duck Bae] As I understand, it’s like a ban

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:26.126
on saying anything hateful?

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:28.213
[Varisha Khan] Safe spaces are environments

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.548
where people that do face racism,

00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:36.318
prejudice of any sort, can truly feel

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:39.020
comfortable and feel safe that they

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.806
will not face racism, prejudice, hatred,

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.426
discrimination, microaggressions.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:47.767
[Keli Carender] It sounds like, from their

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:49.366
own words, that they’re asking for a place

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.325
where certain ideas and opinions and words

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:55.686
and phrases cannot be uttered or thought.

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.656
And I think that if you only feel safe

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:58.722
when you’re around people who think

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:00.248
exactly like you, then there‘s something

00:02:00.248 --> 00:02:01.095
very, very wrong.

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.154
[Autumn Bennett] That’s what I kind of

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.855
thought the safe space was:

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.439
where it’s only kind of one point of view

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.640
is allowed here. But if you meant, like,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.675
a safe space where everyone can disagree,

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:12.170
my response would be, “Well, isn’t that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.191
kind of everywhere?”

00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.850
[Keli Carender] From reading quotes and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.746
interviews with people who support

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:21.215
these things, it seems like it’s a

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.920
place where a certain opinion and a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.889
certain thought is the only one

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.765
that’s okay. Because otherwise,

00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:32.948
you’re going to traumatize people.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:36.428
And that’s very...seems very

00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:37.596
authoritarian to me.

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:38.561
[Louis Chude-Sokei] There are people who say

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:41.247
that safe spaces stifle free speech.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.191
But that argument tends to not realize

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:47.983
that speech can only be free when everyone

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:49.970
involved in the conversation feels

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.022
equally empowered.

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:52.447
[Duck Bae] People thinking about what

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:54.155
they’re saying, and whether or not

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.041
they should be saying it, and being

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.475
more conscious of their actions.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:00.072
[Rachael DeCruz] We are living in a

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:04.430
white-dominated society. And so people

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.547
who fall outside that norm need to have

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:08.701
spaces to go to have conversations with

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:10.467
people who understand their experiences

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:11.902
and who aren’t trying to minimize the

00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:13.405
pain or the trauma that they’re feeling.

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.413
[Leija Farr] So, a safe space is somewhere

00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:17.273
that you’re going and finding similarities

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:19.363
with people when you feel like society

00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:20.915
is working against you.

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:21.978
[Tariqa Waters] You know, we’ve always

00:03:21.978 --> 00:03:23.862
had to do things in secret to survive—

00:03:23.862 --> 00:03:25.873
through slavery through quilting and just,

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:28.405
you know, just in how we communicated

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.238
with one another.

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:30.521
[Louis Chude-Sokei] Although in my really

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.567
sardonic moments, I can make fun of people

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.004
for being too thin-skinned and kind of,

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:37.339
you know, namby-pamby. But I know

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.807
what it was like to be a student,

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:39.906
and I know what it’s like to be

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:43.159
a minority in a largely white environment,

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.260
where people around you aren’t at all

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.580
aware of the tension that they

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.045
generate towards you.

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:50.831
[Lucas Nydham] When you go into your

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.849
typical university classroom as a white man,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.501
you’re already in your safe space.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.754
That space was made for you to be safe.

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:00.221
Like, it was made with you in mind.

00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.523
So when other people, people of other

00:04:02.523 --> 00:04:04.474
backgrounds, go into it, the space

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:05.853
wasn’t necessarily made for them.

00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:07.913
[Jerrell Davis] We grow out of discomfort.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.027
And so if we’re always trying to be in

00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:12.662
a safe space, we ain’t never gonna grow,

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:15.247
you know? If we’re always around people

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:17.584
that are like-minded and have the same

00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:21.808
thoughts as us, we’ll never hear something

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:23.537
that will challenge us or challenge

00:04:23.537 --> 00:04:24.747
our way of thinking.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.606
[Keli Carender] The world is not a safe space.

00:04:26.606 --> 00:04:30.406
You have to be able to be okay with yourself

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:33.644
enough to know that you aren’t right

00:04:33.644 --> 00:04:35.230
all the time. And that other people

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.937
have other opinions from you.

00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:38.526
And—oh, my God—they disagree.

00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:40.383
[Lucas Nydham] People who aren’t familiar

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:41.594
with safe spaces, I don’t think realize

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:43.438
that it’s not a place where everybody

00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:45.469
gets what they want. It’s where everyone

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.599
acknowledges what other people need.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:48.621
[Michael Dixon] Maybe just act like

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.024
human beings towards one another?

00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:54.485
That’s what I would consider a safe space.
