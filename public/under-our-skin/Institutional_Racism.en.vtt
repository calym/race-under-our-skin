00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560

Institutional racism

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.254
[Jerrell Davis] We hold these truths

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:04.151
to be self-evident,

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:06.497
that all men are created equal.

00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:09.095
You know, when they said “all men,”

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:11.274
they weren’t talking about all men.

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:12.330
[Tariqa Waters] We’ve been getting

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.847
shot by the police since

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.034
they let us off, out of shackles.

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.486
I mean, and then there is that: slavery.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.472
I mean, I don’t understand

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:23.139
why we’re talking about race

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.657
and racism like it’s something

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:25.807
that just popped up.

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:26.626
[Lucas Nydam] Growing up as a

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:29.363
white person in a purely white town,

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.362
you only hear about individual racism.

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.463
Systemic racism is where I see

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:34.349
a lot of people who

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:35.550
don’t really understand.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.368
A lot of people can try to dismiss it,

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:39.036
but it’s hard to dismiss systemic

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:41.186
racism because it’s math. It’s data.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.588
People with white-sounding names

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:43.923
getting higher rates

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:46.025
of callbacks on jobs,

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.293
you have prison rates,

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:49.395
you have housing discrimination...

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:50.545
[Cynthia Tee] The percentage of

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:51.711
black people among those that

00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.247
are incarcerated is really high.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.433
Like, the data is there.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:56.767
You can’t deny that there is

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.153
some institutional racism

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:00.053
going on there.

00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:00.655
[Mark Olsen] You know,

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:01.524
all these different statistics…

00:01:01.524 --> 00:01:02.322
The statistics are great,

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:03.472
but they mean nothing

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:04.525
without the context.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.692
If African-American kids are more likely—

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:07.910
or less likely—

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.929
to do as well as white kids,

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.197
I think we’d have to look at

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:14.349
what causes that.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:16.023
Why? What is their environment?

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:17.160
What’s their family life like?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.052
What are the other things that

00:01:19.052 --> 00:01:19.786
are affecting that?

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:20.838
[Autumn Bennett] In order to say that

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.025
there is an actual problem,

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.038
we have to quantify it with actual,

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:26.658
measured proof. And so this idea

00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:27.776
that we have this feeling

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:28.743
that this is happening...

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:30.523
“I’m sure it’s happening somewhere.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.230
[It] probably is happening.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.980
Black people are being arrested

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.523
on a higher level.”

00:01:35.523 --> 00:01:36.683
I don’t agree.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:38.384
I think they may be committing crimes at

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:40.804
a higher rate with a smaller demographic.

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:42.853
I don’t know if that’s right...

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:44.555
[Louis Chude-Sokei] I don’t care where

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.075
you’re from: the numbers are staggering

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.160
in terms of the amount of black people

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.127
getting shot by police,

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:52.495
the incarceration rate.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:54.130
Even if we admit that

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.883
“black people are more criminal”

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.066
—I’m not saying we should admit that—

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.023
but even if we do, the numbers are

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:00.719
still out of control, right?

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.486
The numbers do not even add up to

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.973
greater criminality, statistically.

00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:06.790
[Keli Carender] Institutional racism

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.461
implies that there are different laws

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.559
for different people,

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.144
and there are no longer different laws.

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:12.661
The law’s the law and it’s

00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.347
now applied equally.

00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:16.263
I mean, you know, you would hope.

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:17.176
[Rachael DeCruz] There’s nothing

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:18.793
necessarily in any of

00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:21.284
our policing policies that says

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:22.886
“you should be targeting people of color.”

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.106
But the outcome, right?

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:25.256
we know that the outcome is that

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:26.340
people of color are more

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.310
likely to be stopped,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.142
they’re more likely to be arrested,

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:29.827
they’re more likely to be sentenced,

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:30.477
they’re more likely

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:31.523
to have longer sentences.

00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:32.661
[Greg Rickel] That alone ought to tell

00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:33.728
us we’ve got a problem.

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:35.580
So we don’t have to have laws that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.583
enact it, or at least direct,

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:40.469
blatant laws. We’ve got a system

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.274
now that’s built to keep that and

00:02:43.274 --> 00:02:44.355
to make it go.

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:45.322
[M. Lorena González] They’re a legacy

00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:48.508
of what once were really overt

00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:51.344
discriminatory acts, like preventing

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:53.479
African Americans or any other

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.347
person of any other race from

00:02:55.347 --> 00:02:57.349
buying property in a

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.700
particular part of town.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.286
Predatory lending and access to

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:06.106
education and where schools are built,

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:07.925
where grocery stores are built.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.077
[Rachael] It’s often not like a bunch

00:03:09.077 --> 00:03:10.443
of evil people sitting around in a

00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:12.094
room being like, “We’re going to...”

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:12.894
you know, “We’re going to take all

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.179
we can from this group of people.”

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.014
It’s often, the policies are written

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:18.149
in a way that doesn’t sort of encompass

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.335
the disparities that currently exist

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:23.023
and so they then further those disparities.

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:24.275
[Mark] There have absolutely been examples

00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:25.973
of institutionalized racism.

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:29.227
Yeah. Goodness, Nazi Germany, and I think

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:30.646
even in American history we’ve had

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:34.730
institutionalized racism— 150 years ago.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.881
I’m not saying that there is no

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.467
institutionalized racism. It’s that,

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.485
right now, I’m not sure that what we are,

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:43.854
what we are saying is

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:45.638
institutionalized racism... I don’t know

00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:48.625
that that’s the right phrase for that.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:49.741
[Autumn] I mean, like, when I was

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.127
using in the streets, like,

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:53.128
I got stopped for stuff I didn’t do.

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:54.712
But to say that it’s this widespread

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:57.865
systemic thing… I just, I don’t know.

00:03:57.865 --> 00:03:59.617
I know I stopped having trouble

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:00.568
with the police, though, when I

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:01.569
quit breaking laws.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.719
[Jerrell] I think that most people are

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.187
speaking from experience.

00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:06.956
There has to be some historical,

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:10.259
educational perspective.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.293
[Lorena] We live in a country that is

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:16.113
founded on really deep-seated,

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:18.882
bad history around race,

00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:23.520
from slavery to the Mexican–American War

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.655
to the colonization of America

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:27.373
and what that represents for our

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:28.690
Native American community.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.393
Every slice of history that you look at

00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:32.677
in America has some sort of

00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:35.313
relation to race,

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:37.314
and oppression based on race,

00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:38.849
and exclusion based on race.

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.367
[Louis] People either don’t have the

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:41.773
historical context or deliberately

00:04:41.773 --> 00:04:44.854
do not want to have the context.

00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:46.622
But [if] you’ve distanced yourself from

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:49.024
the history of racism, you’re able to not

00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:50.153
think of it as racism.

00:04:50.153 --> 00:04:51.909
[Darrell Hillaire] If we don’t

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:52.794
know our history,

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:54.378
then we’re bound to be ignorant about

00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:55.963
how we treat one another.

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.699
We need to teach the kids about slavery

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.834
in the school system to say

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.901
that this is really wrong.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.904
So that they’re not raised in

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.505
such a way that, you know, that all is

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.673
just kind of like a blind spot.

00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:09.891
[Greg] It’s privilege

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.777
plus power in a society.

00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:15.178
And that can be different from any society.

00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:17.114
But in ours, it happens to be white.

00:05:17.114 --> 00:05:18.382
[Jerrell] Racism is prejudice

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:20.217
with privilege. It’s structural.

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:24.403
It’s hereditary. And hereditary,

00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:27.672
not like genetically, but you pass on

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:30.707
the values that are rooted in racism

00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:33.342
to your children, and that affects how

00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:34.728
they treat other people.

00:05:34.728 --> 00:05:36.479
[Darrell] You go through the angry phase,

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.732
and you go through the protest phase

00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:41.050
in your life, and then you go through

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.551
this place where you’re just kind of numb,

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.253
you know? It’s like, you know,

00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:46.973
this is getting worse than better,

00:05:46.973 --> 00:05:49.526
you know? But you just have to take it

00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:51.192
upon yourself to educate

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:52.970
as many people as you can.
