WEBVTT

00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:02.646
White Privilege

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.930
[Greg Rickel] I’d say in the white world,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.099
we’re all over the map about what it means

00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:09.340
and whether it’s real or not.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:12.001
If you just bring up white privilege,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.984
you’ve already got divisiveness in the room.

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:16.559
[Tariqa Waters] We’ve existed in it

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:19.364
without even knowing the word for it, I feel.

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:20.675
[M. Lorena González] White privilege

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:27.709
is the acknowledgment that our country

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:33.402
has a deep-seated conflict in history

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:38.043
with race, and that that history has brought us

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.979
to a place where white skin affords you

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:47.704
a greater amount of access to opportunity

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.404
than if your skin wasn’t white.

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.086
[Keli Carender] It almost seems like you're

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.929
accusing somebody of either not having

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:58.014
good intentions or of not deserving

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:00.780
what they have in life

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.080
or not having worked for it.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.058
[Rachael DeCruz] You’re not a bad person

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:04.668
by benefitting from white privilege, right?

00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:05.607
You didn’t really have any choice

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.008
in the matter. But you do have a choice

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:08.594
in kind of how you engage with the world.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:09.560
[Jerrell Davis] And here’s the thing

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.869
about not acknowledging white privilege:

00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:13.898
it’s that you internalize that superiority.

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:15.983
[Sean Riley] I can look at the currency

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:18.121
of our country and everyone on the currency

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:20.167
has the same skin tone as me,

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.795
which reaffirms certain notions about power.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:25.445
You can go to a hotel and expect

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.400
the shampoo to work with your kind of hair.

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.070
[Autumn Bennett] Hotel shampoo is crap,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.268
so who cares? Black people can’t get, like,

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.827
black Band-Aids, and that’s white privilege?

00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:37.179
Band-Aids? I mean, come on.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.866
It’s these little things that I’ve heard...

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.640
[Tariqa Waters] So, my mom would braid

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:43.399
my hair all the time, and it was really long.

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:45.642
And I was over at my grandmother’s house,

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.678
and I said, you know, “I want to be white.”

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:51.686
She almost slapped me across my face

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:53.582
and she said, “Why?” I said,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.129
“Because I wouldn’t have to braid my hair.”

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.362
You know, just these things of just being

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:00.686
able to be free in the world

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.686
without all these restrictions.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.283
I saw that as this oppressive thing.

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:05.292
[Rachael DeCruz] White privilege is the fact

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:07.494
that you don’t have to think about your race.

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:09.203
And when you’re not white, you do

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:10.615
confront that on a daily basis.

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.536
You're reminded on a daily basis

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:12.052
that you’re not white—whether it be

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:15.236
seeing yourself represented in the

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.312
political structure, in the media,

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:18.756
in our education system.

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:19.203
[Cynthia Tee] When you’re favored,

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:19.650
sometimes you just don't even

00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:22.353
really realize you’re favored.

00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:24.153
[Darrell Hillaire] You have no idea.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.375
That’s what white privilege means.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.282
You have no idea.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.624
[Jerrell Davis] Privilege itself is a concept.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.766
Ain’t nobody gonna disagree

00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:34.373
that privilege exists, right?

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:36.983
As a male, I have privilege.

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:37.984
[Louis Chude-Sokei] There’s male privilege,

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:39.748
there’s heterosexual privilege...

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:40.447
[Autumn Bennett] I don’t have any.

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:42.365
Wait: I do have privilege.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:43.365
It's very confusing. I read the list

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:44.921
of privileges a while back and I just was,

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.388
like, “What?!” Like the able-bodied

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:48.946
privilege and female privilege...

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:49.963
[Louis Chude-Sokei] And there’s also

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:50.286
the privilege of, you know,

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.773
being an American. First-world privilege,

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:56.415
even if you’re from Ranier Flats, right?

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:57.758
Or West Oakland.

00:02:58.056 --> 00:02:59.463
[Keli Carender] Anybody can be privileged;

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:00.322
I actually think every group has

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:01.157
has certain privileges.

00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:02.490
[Mark Olsen] I absolutely think

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.490
there's privilege. Sure, sure.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.174
Different people are privileged differently

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.250
than other people. And I think if you look

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:10.469
statistically in America right now,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:11.469
I think you would... I think we would

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.082
find that white people tend to be more

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:18.294
privileged than non-white people.

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.306
With that being said, though,

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:25.556
I’m very hesitant to say there is white...

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:28.126
all white people are privileged,

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:29.697
therefore there is white privilege.

00:03:29.697 --> 00:03:32.586
[Lucas Nydam] You can grow up poor and white

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.393
and still have white privilege,

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:35.641
because it’s white privilege.

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:36.497
It doesn’t mean you’re privileged

00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:37.354
in everything. It just means

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.278
you’re privileged because of your race

00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:41.220
over people of other races.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.063
[Rachael DeCruz] So I think people

00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:42.639
sometimes, when they experience oppression

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.228
in other areas, tend to not see

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:46.795
the privilege that’s in their lives.

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:47.242
[Louis Chude-Sokei] We say, "You have

00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:48.176
white privilege” to someone who's

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:49.891
working five jobs or someone

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:52.279
who can’t get into this school…

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.054
It doesn’t really communicate anything

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.131
to them, and it just generates resentment.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.301
[Sean Riley] I think my skin color

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.884
enhances my freedoms to and my freedoms

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:04.620
from things. I don’t have to worry

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.620
about my skin color being a detriment

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.710
to getting a loan

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.152
or to my possibility of getting a job.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.223
[Michael Dixon] White privilege means

00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:18.081
that you can just be.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.660
The things that are available to you,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.660
you can get. The things that are available

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.012
to me, sometimes I can get,

00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:27.012
sometimes I can't.

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:28.793
[Varisha Khan] White privilege is

00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:31.774
being able to speak out—about your country,

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.255
about your government, about politics—

00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:39.086
without being seen as unloyal or unpatriotic.

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:41.308
[Leija Farr] Look at the media and, like,

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:44.537
look at what images they show you as beautiful.

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.388
Look at what images they show you as powerful.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:48.932
[Duck Bae] Since you don’t look like

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:50.736
this beautiful ideal, and because

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:51.642
that idea happens to be white,

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:52.549
that is the cause of a lot of

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:54.892
internalized racism. Things like that

00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:58.258
make it difficult to hold within you that

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:02.936
kind of pride of the unique beauty that

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:04.261
your race and that you, yourself, hold.

00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:05.301
[Autumn Bennett] “White people have had,

00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:06.351
like, such a better chance in this world.”

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:07.492
Like, no, actually.

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:11.065
Because slavery was over a hundred years ago.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:13.382
You weren’t involved. None of us were.

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:14.795
We don’t have to piggyback on a

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:15.795
poor and bad legacy.

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:16.773
[Louis Chude-Sokei] White privilege is

00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:22.529
the accretion of history that,

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.840
whether you were involved in it or not, directly,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840
directly, has accrued over time

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.973
into your very sense of self and

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:33.570
manifests in how you relate to the world.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.446
[Jerrell Davis] When you give somebody

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:35.322
historical context, to me, it's hard

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:39.568
to deny the truth. And people that say

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:45.845
they don’t have white privilege—

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.374
like, “I worked for everything I got”—

00:05:47.374 --> 00:05:51.273
I mean, I think even that speaks to white privilege.

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:52.273
to white privilege. And this idea that

00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:55.613
we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps?

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:58.309
That’s just bullshit. Like, you better

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:59.645
give some credit to the people

00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:00.645
that are around you,

00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:03.271
because they help you survive.

00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:05.255
[Lucas Nydam] Just talking with my stepdad,

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:08.247
in general, he’s like, "Oh, I worked hard

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:09.247
my whole life.” And I'm like, "I'm sure

00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:10.149
you did, but you also started higher up

00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:15.246
on the ladder than other people

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:18.544
of other colors and other backgrounds.”

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.167
A lot of times people like to think that

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:22.840
everything we do is a result of our

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840
own actions, which is not necessarily

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.403
the case, of course.

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.595
[M. Lorena González] There is no question

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.792
that white folks—even those who come from

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:34.147
a disadvantaged socioeconomic background—

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:36.744
have difficulties and challenges.

00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:39.213
But when you are a person of color,

00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:42.894
those struggles, those barriers,

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:43.894
are deeper and more profound.

00:06:43.894 --> 00:06:46.970
And white privilege is an acknowledgement

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.491
that we are not starting at an equal place.

00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:53.063
That communities of color need

00:06:53.063 --> 00:06:57.297
a head start, if you will,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
just to get to the same start line

00:06:57.297 --> 99:59:59.999
that our white counterparts are at.
