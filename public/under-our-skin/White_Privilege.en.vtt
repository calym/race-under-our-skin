WEBVTT

00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:02.646
White Privilege

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.930
[Greg Rickel] I’d say in the white world,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.128
we’re all over the map about what it means

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.340
and whether it’s real or not.

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.001
If you just bring up white privilege,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.764
you’ve already got divisiveness in the room.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.696
[Tariqa Waters] We’ve existed in it

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.329
without even knowing the word for it, I feel.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.675
[M. Lorena González] White privilege

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:27.649
is the acknowledgment that our country

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:33.402
has a deep-seated conflict in history

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:38.163
with race, and that that history has brought us

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:43.945
to a place where white skin affords you

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:47.704
a greater amount of access to opportunity

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.407
than if your skin wasn’t white.

00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:53.319
[Keli Carender] It almost seems like you're

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.050
accusing somebody of either not having

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.888
good intentions or of not deserving

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.749
what they have in life

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:01.767
or not having worked for it.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.058
[Rachael DeCruz] You’re not a bad person

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:04.536
by benefitting from white privilege, right?

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:05.528
You didn’t really have any choice

00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:07.008
in the matter. But you do have a choice

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:08.605
in kind of how you engage with the world.

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:09.560
[Jerrell Davis] And here’s the thing

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.869
about not acknowledging white privilege:

00:01:11.047 --> 00:01:13.898
it’s that you internalize that superiority.

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:15.983
[Sean Riley] I can look at the currency

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:18.429
of our country and everyone on the currency

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.169
has the same skin tone as me,

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.638
which reaffirms certain notions about power.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.532
You can go to a hotel and expect

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.400
the shampoo to work with your kind of hair.

00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:32.180
[Autumn Bennett] Hotel shampoo is crap,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.764
so who cares? Black people can’t get, like,

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:35.975
black Band-Aids, and that’s white privilege?

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:37.179
Band-Aids? I mean, come on.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.965
It’s these little things that I’ve heard...

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.039
[Tariqa Waters] So, my mom would braid my hair

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.933
all the time, and it was really long.

00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:45.933
And I was over at my grandmother’s house,

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:49.060
and I said, you know, “I want to be white.”

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.822
She almost slapped me across my face

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.518
and she said, “Why?” I said,

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:56.129
“Because I wouldn’t have to braid my hair.”

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.156
You know, just these things of just being

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:00.780
able to be free in the world

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.978
without all these restrictions.

00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:04.283
I saw that as this oppressive thing.

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:05.460
[Rachael DeCruz] White privilege is the fact

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.608
that you don’t have to think about your race.

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:09.103
And when you’re not white, you do

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:10.610
confront that on a daily basis.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.764
You're reminded on a daily basis

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.011
that you’re not white—whether it be

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.639
seeing yourself represented in the

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.312
political structure, in the media,

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:18.953
in our education system.

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:20.065
[Cynthia Tee] When you’re favored,

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:21.173
sometimes you just don't even

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:22.489
really realize you’re favored.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.580
[Darrell Hillaire] You have no idea.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:26.337
That’s what white privilege means.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:28.070
You have no idea.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.624
[Jerrell Davis] Privilege itself is a concept.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.610
Ain’t nobody gonna disagree

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.407
that privilege exists, right?

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:36.983
As a male, I have privilege.

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:38.316
[Louis Chude-Sokei] There’s male privilege,

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.748
there’s heterosexual privilege...

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:40.690
[Autumn Bennett] I don’t have any.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.365
Wait: I do have privilege.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:43.778
It's very confusing. I read the list

00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:45.360
of privileges a while back and I just was,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.229
like, “What?!” Like the able-bodied

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.211
privilege and female privilege...

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:49.963
[Louis Chude-Sokei] And there’s also

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:50.889
the privilege of, you know,

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.706
being an American. First-world privilege,

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:56.415
even if you’re from Ranier Flats, right?

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:57.758
Or West Oakland.

00:02:58.056 --> 00:02:59.557
[Keli Carender] Anybody can be privileged;

00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:00.322
I actually think every group has

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:01.402
has certain privileges.

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:02.490
[Mark Olsen] I absolutely think

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.427
there's privilege. Sure, sure.

00:03:04.882 --> 00:03:06.698
Different people are privileged differently

00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:08.605
than other people. And I think if you look

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.593
statistically in America right now,

00:03:10.593 --> 00:03:12.216
I think you would... I think we would

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:15.614
find that white people tend to be more

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:19.173
privileged than non-white people.

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:21.345
With that being said, though,

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:25.720
I’m very hesitant to say there is white...

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.037
all white people are privileged,

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:29.387
therefore there is white privilege.

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:32.694
[Lucas Nydam] You can grow up poor and white

00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:34.393
and still have white privilege,

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:35.641
because it’s white privilege.

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:36.497
It doesn’t mean you’re privileged

00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:37.354
in everything. It just means

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.278
you’re privileged because of your race

00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:41.323
over people of other races.

00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:42.581
[Rachael DeCruz] So I think people sometimes,

00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.551
when they experience oppression

00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:45.589
in other areas, tend to not see

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.189
the privilege that’s in their lives.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.865
[Louis Chude-Sokei] We say, "You have

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:48.954
white privilege” to someone who's

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.007
working five jobs or someone

00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:52.495
who can’t get into this school…

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:54.702
It doesn’t really communicate anything

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:56.905
to them, and it just generates resentment.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:58.301
[Sean Riley] I think my skin color

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.227
enhances my freedoms to and my freedoms

00:04:01.227 --> 00:04:03.812
from things. I don’t have to worry

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:07.534
about my skin color being a detriment

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:08.710
to getting a loan

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.843
or to my possibility of getting a job.

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:14.883
[Michael Dixon] White privilege means

00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:18.081
that you can just be.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.660
The things that are available to you,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.299
you can get. The things that are available

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:26.012
to me, sometimes I can get,

00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:27.012
sometimes I can't.

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:28.793
[Varisha Khan] White privilege is

00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:31.774
being able to speak out—about your country,

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.255
about your government, about politics—

00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:38.988
without being seen as unloyal or unpatriotic.

00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:41.308
[Leija Farr] Look at the media and, like,

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:44.537
look at what images they show you as beautiful.

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.384
Look at what images they show you as powerful.

00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:48.816
[Duck Bae] Since you don’t look like

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:50.370
this beautiful ideal, and because

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.834
that ideal happens to be white,

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.646
that is the cause of a lot of

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:55.750
internalized racism. Things like that

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.258
make it difficult to hold within you that

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:02.414
kind of pride of the unique beauty that

00:05:02.414 --> 00:05:03.913
your race and that you, yourself, hold.

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:04.863
[Autumn Bennett] “White people have had,

00:05:04.863 --> 00:05:06.351
like, such a better chance in this world.”

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:07.786
Like, no, actually.

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.460
Because slavery was over a hundred years ago.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.142
You weren’t involved. None of us were.

00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:14.369
We don’t have to piggyback on a

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:15.795
poor and bad legacy.

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:17.953
[Louis Chude-Sokei] White privilege is

00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:22.529
the accretion of history that,

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.777
whether you were involved in it or not

00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:28.361
directly, has accrued over time

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.034
into your very sense of self and

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:33.319
manifests in how you relate to the world.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.446
[Jerrell Davis] When you give somebody

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:37.729
historical context, to me, it's hard

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.047
to deny the truth. And people that say

00:05:44.047 --> 00:05:45.778
they don’t have white privilege—

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:47.764
like, “I worked for everything I got”—

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.584
I mean, I think even that speaks to

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:53.935
white privilege. And this idea that

00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:56.661
we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps?

00:05:56.661 --> 00:05:59.001
That’s just bullshit. Like, you better

00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.912
give some credit to the people

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:01.722
that are around you,

00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:03.576
because they help you survive.

00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:05.348
[Lucas Nydam] Just talking with my stepdad,

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:08.493
in general, he’s like, "Oh, I worked hard

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.076
my whole life.” And I'm like, "I'm sure

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:13.299
you did, but you also started higher up

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.246
on the ladder than other people

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:18.130
of other colors and other backgrounds.”

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.093
A lot of times people like to think that

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:22.566
everything we do is a result of our

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:24.917
own actions, which is not necessarily

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.403
the case, of course.

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.595
[M. Lorena González] There is no question

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.792
that white folks—even those who come from

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.992
a disadvantaged socioeconomic background—

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:36.342
have difficulties and challenges.

00:06:36.342 --> 00:06:39.716
But when you are a person of color,

00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:42.894
those struggles, those barriers,

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.461
are deeper and more profound.

00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.916
And white privilege is an acknowledgement

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:51.792
that we are not starting at an equal place.

00:06:51.792 --> 00:06:54.592
That communities of color need

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:56.536
a head start, if you will,

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:59.284
just to get to the same start line

00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:01.462
that our white counterparts are at.
