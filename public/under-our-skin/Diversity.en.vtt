Diversity

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.200
[M. Lorena González] “Diversity” is

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.163
one of these words that has become

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.778
very watered down to mean just about

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.460
anything that you can think about.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.812
[Louis Chude-Sokei] Diversity is something

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:17.806
that is often said and asked for.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:20.735
But like all the other terms, the meanings

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.485
have never been fully established.

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:24.459
[Keli Carender] What it seems to mean

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:28.506
is looks. We have a black person,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:29.363
we have a white person, we have

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.640
a Hispanic person, we have a female...

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.829
You need this many people from this race

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.047
and this many women and this many...whatever.

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:39.438
[Varisha Khan] Diversity means coming from

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.717
anything that’s different, any walk of life

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:43.794
that’s different. So that includes race,

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.530
that includes religion.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.188
[Cynthia Tee] ...can be gender identification,

00:00:49.188 --> 00:00:51.932
can be sexual orientation,

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:54.528
can be disability or ability.

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:55.785
[Marci Owens] ...not just races—

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.594
like people coming from poor families

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.013
and people coming from rich families

00:00:59.013 --> 00:01:00.576
and middle class.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:02.348
[Mark Olsen] Diversity is also defined

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:06.518
by ideology, by religion, by thought process.

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:07.554
[M. Lorena González] I think, to me,

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:12.040
diversity has to be rooted in race,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.004
ethnicity, and gender. And I limit it

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.642
to those categories very intentionally,

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:25.197
because really what we’re talking about

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:28.966
is including people in an environment where

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.611
they have not historically been included.

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.297
[Mark Olsen] I think we have to be

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:35.340
really careful with how we define diversity.

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:39.502
If there’s a, you know, a city council

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:41.861
full of people of many different races

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:43.846
and stuff but they all think the same way,

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:46.061
that doesn’t make it a diverse city council.

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:46.917
[Louis Chude-Sokei] The difficulty with

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:49.491
Seattle is that diversity and privilege

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:50.850
and these issues become largely

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.520
intellectual exercises, and people don’t

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.061
actually spend a whole lot of time

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:56.879
just in a place where they’re...

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.605
where they’re on someone else’s terms.

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.024
In a place where English isn’t the

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.145
primary language, right? In a place

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:04.436
where your norms and expectations

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.026
are turned upside down.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.325
[Leija Farr] Diversity is just, like,

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.467
going outside of your boundaries

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.332
of what you feel is, like, comfortable,

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:14.044
and seeing different things.

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:15.409
[Duck Bae] Exposing yourself to people

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.182
you have very little in common with

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:20.254
and having to make that extra effort

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:21.744
to find things you do have in common

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:24.900
with them. And that’s a very scary thing.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.537
Even in some of the most diverse cities

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:28.022
of America you’ll ultimately see that

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.335
people gravitate towards people

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:30.678
they have a lot of similarity with.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:31.784
[Michael Dixon] I don’t want to be

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.001
diversified out of existence.

00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:35.973
The downside of diversity

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:36.958
is gentrification.

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.090
[Louis Chude-Sokei] The world is diverse

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.620
but the professional worlds are becoming

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.123
increasingly segregated. I’ve had much

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:43.832
trouble over the years trying to explain

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:46.554
to African-American people that diversity

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:49.037
means more than just white people hiring you.

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:49.909
[Autumn Bennett] What if the two people

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.576
have the exact same qualifications?

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.443
Like, then how do… I mean, are they supposed

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:54.669
to choose a minority? So if there’s a

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.327
black guy and a white guy and they have

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:58.081
the same qualifications, is the person

00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.568
supposed to choose the black guy?

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.441
I mean, how does that work out?

00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:03.344
[Rachael DeCruz] I feel like a lot of

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.084
decisions are made assuming that the

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.133
playing field is level and equal,

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:11.855
and they’re not. Often times, our country’s

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:15.800
focus on the individual and this narrative of,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.552
like, “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps!

00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:18.921
You work hard and you play by the rules,

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:20.716
and you’ll be able to get ahead in life.”

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.542
And that’s damaging because it’s not true.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.498
You know, we each come into this world

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.826
with a set of lived experiences

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.625
that have shaped us, and I think

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:31.754
finding ways to meet people

00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:33.656
where they’re at is really important.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:35.940
[Cynthia Tee] The whole tech space is

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.269
fundamentally very biased. And so you

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.023
have to do things differently in order to

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:44.206
make sure that people who are oppressed

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:47.304
feel welcome in that environment.

00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:49.891
And feel like they belong. And stay there.

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.305
[Lucas Nydam] “Diversity” I don’t think is

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:53.790
a strong enough word. Just because they’re

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.274
present doesn’t mean they’re heard.

00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:57.009
So it’s like you can have a room

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.965
and have it be very diverse but still

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:01.739
have only one person—one background—talking,

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.733
one group of people supported and engaged.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.246
[Louis Chude-Sokei] It is kind of naïve

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.880
to assume that just by putting a lot of

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.814
people from all over the place in one job

00:04:10.814 --> 00:04:12.520
or in one office or in one classroom

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.161
that automatically—boom!

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.821
[M. Lorena González] Which is why we see,

00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:19.014
you know, folks who work in that area

00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:20.839
moving towards the term of “inclusion.”

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.212
[Cynthia Tee] Inclusivity requires the ability

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:29.135
to really examine your own biases and

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.307
be willing to admit that you’re biased.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:33.149
And inclusivity is how you create

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:34.387
an environment where they all

00:04:34.387 --> 00:04:35.647
feel like they belong there.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.353
[Lucas Nydham] When you bring diverse people

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:38.739
to the table, you realize

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.264
things that you didn’t know before

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:42.871
because they were invisible to you

00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.149
because of your experience.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:46.769
Because our experiences are

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:47.831
shaped by our race.

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:51.959
[Sean Riley] I believe that to be around

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.259
folks who see things differently than you

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.535
is good for you. And the more that

00:04:57.535 --> 00:05:00.560
can happen in your life, the more expansive

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.570
your own sense of identity will be,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.551
and the more you’ll understand yourself.

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:05.610
[Autumn Bennett] I don’t know.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.089
I also think that when you have exposure

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.066
to the opposite race, or another race,

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.179
it kind of makes your preconceived notions

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.436
a little different.
