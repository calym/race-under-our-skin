00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
White Fragility

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.830
[Darrell Hillaire] I have no idea what that means.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.440
White… fragility?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.682
[Leija Farr] Fragility makes me think about

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.761
something being, you know, easily broken.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.885
[Greg Rickel] I don’t know that

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.215
as a term I’ve heard,

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:16.048
but when I read it I thought very much

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:19.895
of just how fragile white folks are when

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.609
we have this conversation.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.335
We fall apart in the face of

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:27.169
any encounter with the thought

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.038
that we may be part of racism,

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:30.922
or that we have some part in playing

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:32.154
in how to solve it.

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:33.017
[Cynthia Tee] The first thing that comes

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:34.923
to mind is maybe somebody

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:39.279
who’s white who feels very unjustly

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.652
accused of having any privilege

00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:46.087
or being racist or anything like that,

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.518
purely based on the fact that

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:48.691
they don’t have that intention.

00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:49.730
[Louis Chude-Sokei] That’s a real thing

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.074
in a place like Seattle, certainly.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:52.387
[Sean Riley] Seattleites can be sort of

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:53.920
fragile, and I really do think we don’t

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.176
like discomfort and we don’t like conflict.

00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:58.238
[Marci Owens] I think people are afraid

00:00:58.238 --> 00:00:59.627
to be wrong about things,

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:02.717
and that’s why people are so timid

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:03.507
to talk about this.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.638
[Michael Dixon] Well, I don’t think white

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:05.867
people are fragile.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:07.284
I think they’re ignorant.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:09.258
[Lucas Nydam] I never got those skills

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:10.773
of being able to talk about race,

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:12.030
and that’s where a lot of people are

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.577
right now in our country.

00:01:13.577 --> 00:01:14.840
They’re just starting these

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.311
conversations, so they’re fragile.

00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:17.727
They can feel attacked because they’ve

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:19.104
never really had to think about it.

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:21.365
They’ll feel so hurt because they didn’t

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:22.850
realize things they were doing were

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.327
racist or supporting racist systems.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:26.802
[Jerrell Davis] [It’s] this need to be

00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:29.821
hella sensitive when we’re talking about

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.122
race and ethnicity.

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.384
Like, you would think it would be the

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.037
people that are being disenfranchised and

00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:38.842
held back that would be the most sensitive,

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.570
you know? But no:

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.536
it’s the people that are benefitting from

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.397
it that we have to, like, water down and

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.222
sugarcoat terms… “Don’t say white privilege.

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:50.846
Don’t say white supremacy.”

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.767
[Louis] It is the sense that all

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:55.142
conversations about race or inequity

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:58.500
ultimately must be had in such a way as

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.724
to not threaten whites.

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:04.048
Because well-meaning whites often,

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:07.701
you know, see themselves as above the fray.

00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:08.695
[Rachael DeCruz] I think a lot of

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.456
conversations around race and privilege

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:15.457
and oppression...Oftentimes people of color

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:17.873
will make them feel better or more

00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:19.376
digestible for white people.

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:22.010
The point is to expose some stuff

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.345
that’s happening, whether or not

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:24.610
people want to hear it.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.877
[Duck Bae] In the nation where you’ve

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:27.372
always been catered to,

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:31.248
and you’ve never known, really, about it,

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.636
or stopped to consider it, suddenly

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:36.025
having people talk to you about it—having

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:38.702
people explain to you that you’ve been

00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:42.963
advantaged all your life—could

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:46.808
understandably make someone fragile and

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:50.759
unwilling to face those new realities.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.768
[Greg] Very quickly I would go to,

00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:58.653
“Oh, so, I’m to blame for all of this?

00:02:58.653 --> 00:03:01.773
You know, I was born in 1963. My parents

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:04.681
were part of the civil rights movement.

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:07.444
And you’re blaming me? I’m not a racist.

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:09.801
I don’t do...I don’t tell bad jokes.

00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:13.623
Some of my best friends are black people.”

00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:15.603
You know, that’s fragility.

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:17.323
That’s kind of...we race to that,

00:03:17.323 --> 00:03:20.259
and kind of want that to suffice,

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.773
you know, to get us off the hook.

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:24.402
[Leija] Like, when you’re telling them,

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:25.841
“This is what I’m going through,”

00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.979
and they’re like, “Well, why are you

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.695
blaming this on me?” Like, I’m not blaming.

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:32.434
I’m not singling you out. You know?

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:34.207
I’m just telling you what I’m going through.

00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:35.829
And I’m trying to have you listen.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.425
And, you know, they feel like you’re

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.661
attacking them.

00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:39.671
Like, “Why are you attacking me?”

00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.873
[Darrell] We’re trying to say this

00:03:40.873 --> 00:03:42.948
system is messed up. You know?

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:44.935
This system creates these divisions

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:45.854
amongst us, you know.

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:47.177
[Autumn Bennett] Is it OK to feel uncomfortable?

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:49.697
Yes. Should they feel defensive or like

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.320
they’re responsible for it all? No.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.181
Should they be taking on the fragility

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.139
and the guilt or whatever of all the

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.973
previous racist white people

00:03:57.973 --> 00:03:59.296
on the planet? No.

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.916
[Marci] It’s OK to be human.

00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:02.545
Like, it’s OK to make mistakes

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.423
and it’s OK to be wrong about things.

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:07.013
But the one thing about being human

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.083
is that we learn.

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:09.795
[Varisha Khan] Someone who is

00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:12.091
used to privilege…

00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:16.461
To them, equality will feel like injustice.

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:17.663
When someone is so used to having a

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:20.007
leg up over someone else, now when

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:21.481
someone else has caught up to them,

00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:22.284
now you feel like

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:23.509
you have to share something.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:24.502
And you feel like...

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:25.117
suddenly you feel like

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:26.233
you’re losing something,

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.424
when the reality is you’re

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:28.705
just sharing the same space.
