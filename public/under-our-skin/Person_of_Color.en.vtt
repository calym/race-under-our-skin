00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.425
Person of color

00:00:01.787 --> 00:00:02.753
[Cynthia Tee] “Person of color,” for me,

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:03.528
means not white.

00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:05.743
[Varisha Khan] A person of color is someone

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:07.668
who, I guess very simply, is not white.

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:08.774
[Jerrell Davis] People know what we mean.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:09.668
We mean that we ain’t white.

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:11.048
[M. Lorena González] “Person of color”

00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:14.138
is an inclusive term that I think

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:17.696
provides a less pejorative way to

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:21.500
define minority. I don’t like the word

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.291
“minority” because it immediately has

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.569
a sense of disempowerment.

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:27.665
[Jerrell Davis] Even that term,

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:29.863
the term “minority,” is so, like,

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.705
contextually based. Because, like, on Earth,

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.163
there’s way more people of color

00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:38.333
than there are white people. Like,

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.430
80 percent of Earth are people of color.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.831
Like, let’s embrace our differences

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.105
without having to, like, create labels

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:48.912
that have this contextual superiority

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:50.155
or inferiority to them.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:51.464
[Darrell Hillaire] Yeah, it was embarrassing

00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:54.688
as a kid. You’re made to feel embarrassed

00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:58.150
for being a person of color. That means

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.157
somebody’s looking down on you.

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:00.119
[Autumn Bennett] I think it’s just, like,

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.246
a way to avoid saying “black,”

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:04.652
because suddenly “black” is offensive.

00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:06.587
People stumble when they try to say, you know,

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.912
like, “Oh, she’s bl...Afr...” I’m black!

00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:12.308
I feel like it’s, like, taking over

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:13.487
where “colored” left off.

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:14.538
[Jerrell Davis] Like, bro, I’m not

00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:16.785
a load of laundry. It’s like,

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.565
“Do you wanna be colored? Called colored?”

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.295
Like, look, if somebody called me colored—

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:24.820
if a white person called me colored—

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.024
we’re having a problem.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:27.812
[Michael Dixon] Don’t call me that.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.324
I’m black. Don’t call me African American.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.635
Because I’m black.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.018
Those are political terms.

00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:37.849
[Tariqa Waters] To say I’m black and to then

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.156
identify other people as people of color

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:42.811
are two very separate things.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.297
For a white person to say “a person of color,”

00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:46.832
it’s really easy to just…

00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:48.906
It’s a politically correct term that is

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:51.301
getting overused. And that’s here in Seattle.

00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.502
I go to Atlanta, I’m black, you know?

00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:54.619
I go to D.C., I’m black.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.900
[Greg Rickel] I have to admit I struggle

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.093
with what terms to use and when.

00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:00.626
And, you know, there’s some impersonality

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.768
in saying “person of” anything.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:04.631
[Tariqa Waters] There’s just such a wealth

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:08.789
that gets overlooked and generalized

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.675
in the term “person of color.”

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:11.541
[Louis Chude-Sokei] “Person of color”

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.441
is a term that I know I gravitate more to

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:17.463
than “black,” simply because even within

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:19.580
the black world there are people who are black

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.187
who don’t see themselves as black because

00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:22.678
“black” means African American.

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:25.311
And so “person of color” is a broader,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.834
more inclusive term.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:27.466
[M. Lorena González] I don’t think it’s

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:31.616
intended to devalue what your own

00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:33.276
self-identification might be.

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:36.553
I think it’s more of a construct to recognize

00:02:36.553 --> 00:02:38.793
we share more in common in terms of

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:41.191
oppression and difficulties, in accessing

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:42.770
opportunity, as a collective.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.363
[Rachael DeCruz] I identify as

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.340
a woman of color. I feel like I fit

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.629
into a pretty unique, privileged space

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.108
in the world, because you look at me

00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:53.898
and you know that I’m not white, right?

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:55.531
But you don’t know exactly what I am.

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:57.368
My skin color, like, is seen as less

00:02:57.368 --> 00:02:59.301
threatening than someone who’s darker than me.

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:01.237
[Duck Bae] I personally don’t identify

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:04.247
as a person of color, because I think

00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:05.970
it comes with inherent disadvantages

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.618
that I myself haven’t faced in the same way.

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:10.440
Sure, there are disadvantages with being

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.152
Asian American, but they—quite literally—

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.841
pale in comparison. They tend to be, oddly,

00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.394
much more positive things. And I haven’t

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:21.664
been associated with...I don’t think

00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:22.972
anyone’s ever associated me

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:23.672
with a life of crime.

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:27.201
[Jerrell Davis] It conflates all non-white

00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:29.821
people, and so then people assume that,

00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:34.018
like, there’s a blanket experience of

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:37.218
all people of color. Like, “Oh, you’re Korean?

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.668
I’m black. We bein’ held down by the man!”

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:43.204
And she’s like, “Um, not really.”

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:46.126
[Duck Bae] It also might be my way of

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.658
conveniently distancing myself

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.945
from everything. If I don’t tie myself

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:52.029
into it—if I put myself on the side of

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:57.111
advantage—then it kind of enables me

00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.347
to kind of break away from the conflict

00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:00.754
between black and white. And I’m like,

00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:03.218
“Oh, no, guys, this isn’t for me.

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:05.435
I’m not a person of color.”

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:06.871
And if I’m not a person of color,

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:11.517
then I guess I might just end up an

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.656
aggressor or a bystander that chooses

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:16.031
to do nothing about changing the status quo.

00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.630
[Cynthia Tee] Chinese people I think,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.821
in general, when it comes to issues of racism—

00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:22.232
even if we have a lot of cultural institutional

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:23.695
racism ourselves—tend to be, like,

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.448
kind of neutral in this particular space

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:29.010
all the time. Being a person of color,

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.092
meaning non-white, helps me identify

00:04:32.092 --> 00:04:34.730
with not being part of the majority.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.196
But I’m not necessarily a minority, either.

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:38.123
[Autumn Bennett] It doesn’t really help

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:40.011
if you’re trying to, like, you know,

00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:41.635
ID a suspect or something like that.

00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:42.751
Like, that’s kind of vague.

00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:43.544
“It was a person of color!”

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:44.992
White people still have color to their skin.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:46.743
Like, there’s olive shades and really

00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:49.063
porcelain shades and all in between.

00:04:49.063 --> 00:04:50.996
[Darrell Hillaire] We’re all people of color.

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:51.848
Every one of us.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.314
[Greg Rickel] You know, I could argue

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:56.888
in an abstract way that we, you know,

00:04:56.888 --> 00:04:58.453
we’re all colorful people

00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:00.673
and we’re all persons of diversity.

00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:02.960
We have a lot of richness in each one of us.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.333
But we all know what it means when

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.525
we hear that. It’s somebody not white.

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.528
And so I struggle with it a little bit,

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:14.012
but I have to admit I use it just because

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:16.247
it seems like a term that works

00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:18.163
in discussion. And I don’t know

00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:20.193
that it’s right, but I do use it.
