00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.062
Politically Correct

00:00:01.062 --> 00:00:01.671
What does “politically correct” mean to you?

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:02.893
[Marci Owens] Saying something that could

00:00:02.893 --> 00:00:04.850
offend people without offending people.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.469
[Duck Bae] Using one word as opposed

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:07.941
to another.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:08.975
[Jerrell Davis] Politically correct?

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.167
That’s some shit white people made up.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.477
To be straight up, like, I didn’t even

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:15.697
hear that term until I got to college.

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:16.699
[Darrell Hillaire] It’s something that

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.183
those people in the non-Indian world

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:21.223
use quite often. You know, “We gotta be

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:22.722
politically correct. We gotta call them

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.254
Native Americans, not Indians.”

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.024
[Greg Rickel] I think it always was,

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:29.555
to a degree, “How do you say things nicely?

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.507
And in ways that will not hurt people?”

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:36.103
[Tariqa Waters] I hate political correctness.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.979
Oh, it gets on my nerves, and I don’t think

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.142
it’s needed. It ruined our ability to

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:41.838
communicate with one another,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.349
where you could call somebody out

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:48.313
for being whatever they were being to you.

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:49.353
If somebody said something that was

00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:50.931
offensive, you knew it immediately.

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.726
They were being offensive. Now, to me,

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:55.070
it’s more offensive if you are really

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.667
trying to figure out how not to offend me.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.505
I don’t think you’re really expressing

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.404
how you truly feel when you’re being

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:02.674
so politically correct.

00:01:02.674 --> 00:01:03.586
[Autumn Bennett] Making sure that we

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:04.920
don’t offend and we just sort of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.948
maintain this, like, neutral.

00:01:06.948 --> 00:01:08.292
You’re just too afraid to take a stance.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.107
[Keli Carender] You know, saying things

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:12.073
that are found to be acceptable

00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:13.731
within a certain box.

00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:15.189
[Duck Bae] Opponents would argue that

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.651
it’s sugarcoating or pandering

00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:19.978
to another group of people.

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:22.016
Proponents would say that

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:23.611
it’s only what’s right.

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.111
It’s just basic human decency

00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:27.661
that we treat others with respect.

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.477
[Greg Rickel] I really prefer

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:33.281
to use the word “civility.”

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:33.852
[Autumn Bennett] There’s a difference

00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:35.598
between, you know, being an asshole

00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:38.563
and just speaking what could be truth.

00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:39.898
It is politically incorrect to say

00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:42.274
that you can’t change your gender.

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:44.130
It is politically incorrect to say

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.900
that Black Lives Matter movement

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.518
is racist. But I believe those things

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:50.431
to be true. And I don’t believe them

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:51.874
to be insulting or mean.

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:54.676
[Mark Olsen] I think if we substituted

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:56.692
being polite or politeness instead of

00:01:56.692 --> 00:01:58.309
politically correct, I think we might

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:59.619
actually make some progress.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.674
[Jerrell Davis] When people talk about

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:02.283
being politically correct, it’s like,

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:04.682
“You can’t say it like that.”

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:06.399
They don’t say, “You shouldn’t say that.”

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.924
They don’t say, “You shouldn’t think

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:10.619
like that.” You just can’t say it like that.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.413
[Rachael DeCruz] I go back and forth

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:13.095
in my mind about whether or not

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:14.850
it’s better to have somebody be

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.221
blatantly racist or just kind of

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.856
say the right things but then

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:19.984
actually be racist.

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:21.628
[Mark Olsen] I think people don’t enjoy

00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:23.740
feeling that there’s restrictions on what

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.729
they can and cannot say.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.184
[Sean Riley] People talk about

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:29.911
political correctness derisively because it’s...

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:32.486
“What should I not say?”

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.975
And I would like to frame things around,

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.941
“Well, how do I make sure I say things

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.336
that respect the dignity and the

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.626
humanity of the person in front of me?”

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.390
So it’s not like avoiding getting caught,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.482
but it’s proactively engaging with others

00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:49.223
and their dignity.

00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:49.889
[Keli Carender] I don’t think that

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.431
we should be putting labels on whole

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:54.957
vast parts of our language, trying to

00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:57.176
make them unacceptable.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.640
When you take away free speech,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.067
I mean, you kill a free society.

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:02.074
[Lucas Nydam] A lot of people say

00:03:02.074 --> 00:03:03.398
political correctness is limiting

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:04.777
free speech. But I think, like,

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:07.785
when people just dismiss criticism

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:09.748
as being politically correct and

00:03:09.748 --> 00:03:11.492
don’t address it, that’s more limiting

00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:13.225
to free speech. Like, people bring up,

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:14.849
“Hey, you might be being racist,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.985
whether intentionally or unintentionally.”

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:18.088
And people are like, “No, you’re just

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:19.524
being politically correct.” And then

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:21.278
they just dismiss that argument

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:22.783
without ever really addressing it.

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:24.512
[Louis Chude-Sokei] Now, you’re being checked.

00:03:24.512 --> 00:03:25.897
They say, “What do you mean by that?”

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:26.943
“Wait a minute—that’s wrong.

00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:28.250
What about this?” Right?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.158
And so the people who are most hostile

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.629
to this thing called “politically correct”

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.796
are people who don’t like to be checked.

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:37.805
Right? And people who feel that their power

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:42.441
and authority is being whittled away

00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:44.669
by being checked. But what they were

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.417
responding to was people saying that,

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:50.216
“Look, not only do your words and ideas

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:52.773
have repercussions in the immediate world

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:55.652
around you,” right, [but] there are

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.720
more and more people who are feeling

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.817
empowered to check you. And that’s

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:01.990
what people are upset about.
