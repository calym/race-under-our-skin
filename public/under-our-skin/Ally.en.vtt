00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.075
Ally

00:00:02.075 --> 00:00:03.052
[Tariqa Waters] Oh, man,

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:05.185
just be somebody’s friend!

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.512
I don’t know . . .

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:07.220
[Jerrell Davis] I don’t know—

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.403
I hear “allies,” I think of war.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:09.686
[Autumn Bennett] The term “ally,” to me,

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:11.384
typically applies to, like, countries in war.

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:15.041
[Cynthia Tee] “Ally” is really somebody

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:18.502
in the privileged camp being able to

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:20.458
champion somebody who is not privileged

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:21.559
or being targeted.

00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:23.420
[Sean Riley] Someone who stands up

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.115
for the marginalized, knowing that there’s

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.775
probably a social cost to that.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:29.311
[Mark Olsen] The way I understand that word

00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.623
is it’s somebody who is sympathetic or has

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.371
joined a cause that they feel that they

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.737
normally wouldn’t because they’re white.

00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:42.157
I really don’t like the word because it is

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:45.625
very divisive. It emphasizes these

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.786
battle lines that we have.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:49.091
[Autumn Bennett] So it’s like we’re using

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:50.606
war terms to determine, like, support of

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.557
groups and that’s, like... We’ve turned this

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.485
into some sort of social war.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:55.673
[Mark Olsen] I don’t think it’s helpful,

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:57.457
because we’re all in it together.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.204
[Jerrell Davis] People always seem to

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:00.357
put it on us. Like, “Black folk, y’all

00:01:00.357 --> 00:01:01.824
just need to get y’all communities together,

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:04.507
and then you can rise.” And it’s like, bro,

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:06.940
there’s only so many of us and we’re living

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.374
in a culture that we don’t control the output.

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:12.891
We gotta address the people that do,

00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:14.989
and they gotta be on our team.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.023
We got to speak to the white folk.

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:17.490
[Rachael DeCruz] They’re able to use their

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.358
privilege in that space to kind of either

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.453
hold other people accountable or have

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:23.590
a different kind of conversation.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.190
When it’s coming from another white person,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.841
people receive it differently.

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:29.150
It feels different, right?

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.255
It’s coming from a peer.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:31.976
[Marci Owens] We kind of get that stamp of, like,

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.110
“Oh, an angry black man or black woman” again.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.976
But if a white person kind of steps up,

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:38.560
it kind of becomes just a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.992
different voice in the fight.

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:41.209
[Tariqa Waters] I would have, you know,

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.192
a little more respect for the White Privilege single

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.925
that Macklemore dropped if he didn’t ask

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.943
so many people of color to participate

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.958
in the song. Just do it. Say it.

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.542
Go out there and say it by yourself.

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:55.943
You’ve been in the world long enough

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:56.943
to know the deal.

00:01:56.943 --> 00:01:58.063
[Louis Chude-Sokei] We made a joke

00:01:58.063 --> 00:01:59.534
in media that it's always like...

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.242
one of the best jobs for black actors

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:03.408
is the black best friend, right?

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:05.319
Or the sassy black girlfriend, right?

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.605
The ally is, like, the white friend.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:10.419
The righteous white guy, right?

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.638
The "down" white girl.

00:02:11.638 --> 00:02:12.950
[Keli Carender] I don’t really have a lot of

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.254
experience with that word. I don’t know...

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:15.889
I would consider myself an ally of most people.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.193
Because I want everyone to have freedom.

00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.058
I believe in individual rights.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:22.943
I don’t believe in group rights.

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:26.142
I believe every individual has the same rights

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:27.975
as every other individual. Ayn Rand said that

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.543
the smallest minority is the individual.

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:32.725
[Greg Rickel] I can’t claim I’m an ally.

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:36.275
I think the people that need me as an ally

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.058
are the only ones that can say that I am one.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:39.909
And what I’d hope to be is

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.242
someone who listens more than talks.

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:43.259
[M. Lorena González] A good white ally

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.275
will give space to communities of color

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:48.693
and leaders within communities of color

00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:50.859
to set the agenda and lead on the agenda.

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.824
[Leija Farr] Some white people, they'll

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:55.509
stand in the front and kind of, like. . .

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.542
I mean, I know they’re trying to support.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.775
But you have to, like, let us take our actions.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.790
And then just be that support system that we go to.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.743
[Tariqa Waters] Malcolm X said it best:

00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:08.859
“You can help, but you can’t join.”

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.525
I was like, “Oh, no!”

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:11.557
[Varisha Khan] When you’re from an

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:12.758
underprivileged group, there’s a lot of things

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.291
that you wish that someone from a position

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:16.992
of privilege will do to help you,

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:18.658
whether that’s speaking in a certain way,

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:20.874
or whether that’s not speaking at all.

00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:22.508
If you really, truly do want to help,

00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:24.091
listen to what we have to say.

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:26.025
[Marci Owens] If you don’t take the time

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:27.059
to learn about their struggle,

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.575
I don’t think you can properly

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:30.975
be an ally or say you’re an ally.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:32.590
[Duck Bae] Be like, “I’m here to listen.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.824
Please tell me everything. I’m ignorant,

00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:37.091
and I acknowledge it,

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.758
and I’d like you to teach me.”

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:40.608
[Darrell Hillaire] Willing to listen and understand

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:45.541
and stand up for each other’s beliefs.

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:47.007
Even if we disagree, you know?

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:48.525
[Autumn Bennett] I don’t support any type of victimhood.

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.158
So I think an ally is somebody who is like,

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:54.858
in some ways, feels like if they don’t do this,

00:03:54.858 --> 00:03:55.873
they’ll either be A) out of the group,

00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:58.340
or B) they’re somehow bad for not

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.158
supporting something. And I think

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:01.724
that’s what happens to a lot of people—

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:03.573
they just feel, like, pressured into it.

00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:06.526
Because, trust me: not agreeing with all this stuff

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:09.208
is way harder than agreeing with it.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:10.590
[Keli Carender] You should have this phrase on here:

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.026
“virtue signalling.” I think that a lot of people

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:14.624
practice virtue signalling.

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:15.957
So they get to signal to other people

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:18.074
that they are virtuous.

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.557
[Tariqa Waters] If it’s a Beyoncé or

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:22.378
Macklemore song, it's easy to play

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.290
and say, “Yeah, I played it. I shared it.”

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.274
You know? “I hashtagged it. I’m done.”

00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:28.824
[Duck Bae] “Ally,” when it is used incorrectly,

00:04:28.824 --> 00:04:32.374
is slapping a term on yourself and being like,

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:34.606
“My job is now done. I’m an ally.”

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:36.573
[Louis Chude-Sokei] It becomes a way of

00:04:36.573 --> 00:04:41.408
demonstrating your moral and political rectitude—

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:43.590
that you’re on “the right side of history”

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.992
because of who you affiliate yourself with, right?

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.957
It doesn’t mean that you’re doing work.

00:04:48.957 --> 00:04:50.706
[Cynthia Tee] There’s a lot of really good intention.

00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:53.122
And yet the gap between good intention

00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:55.507
and the ability to be a strong ally

00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:57.257
is actually a lot bigger than I think

00:04:57.257 --> 00:04:58.957
most people think it is.

00:04:58.957 --> 00:04:59.906
There’s a lot to be learned

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:02.490
that’s actually not very obvious.
